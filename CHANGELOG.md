# v2.1 Released Sep 11, 2019

### New features

- GitHub organization folders now support a default Jenkinsfile.  See [PR
  #12][#12].

[#12]: https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-multibranch-defaults-plugin/pull/12

### Warnings

**Multibranch Pipeline with defaults** job type will be removed next release.

# v2.0 Released Oct 1, 2018

### Warnings

Pipeline multibranch defaults plugin v1.1 and older created a new Job type named
**Multibranch Pipeline with defaults**.  This is considered a design flaw.
Convert all jobs using this old type to a normal `Multibranch Pipeline` job
type.

**Multibranch Pipeline with defaults** will be removed in a later release.

### New features

- Sandbox support has been added for better flexibility in security.  See [PR
  #3][#3].
- `Jenkinsfile` ID is customizable from the config file provider plugin which
  means different multibranch pipelines may use a different default
  `Jenkinsfile`.  See [PR #3][#3], [JENKINS-41108][JENKINS-41108].
- Job DSL syntax is fixed and now includes new sandbox and customizable
  `Jenkinsfile`.  See [PR #3][#3], [JENKINS-43285][JENKINS-43285].
